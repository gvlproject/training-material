# Package, dependency and environment management

---

class: enlarge120

### .image-25[![](../../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Conda Terminology

Conda **recipes** build **packages** that are published to **channels**.

---

class: enlarge120

### .image-25[![](../../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br /> Conda Key Features for Galaxy

- No compilation at install time - *binaries* with their dependencies, libraries...
- Support for all operating systems Galaxy targets
- Easy to manage *multiple versions* of the same recipe
- HPC-ready: no root privileges needed
- Easy-to-write YAML recipes
- **Community** - not *restricted* to Galaxy

???

- Recipes: independent of the progamming language in which software is written
- Support for multiple versions at the same time is needed for reproducibility

Compared with the Tool Shed dependency management (`tool_dependencies.xml`), BioConda is:

- More popular!
- Easier to develop.
- Easier to install and test.

### .image-25[![](../../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Best Practice Channels

- Packages through channels within Continuum.
- Conda channels searched by Galaxy for packages
    - iuc
    - bioconda
    - defaults
    - conda-forge

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

.footnote[If you are interested in Natural Language Processing or Cheminformatics you may be asking if these channels can still work for your tools. Despite the name [Bioconda] (https://bioconda.github.io/) - it is really more about community and a set of best practices than about bioinformatics purity - many diverse packages have been integrated.]

### .image-25[![](../../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Install and Configure

```bash
$ planemo conda_init
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/miniconda3/bin
$ which conda
/Users/john/miniconda3/bin/conda
```

Planemo installs Conda using miniconda and configured defaults designed to easy development.

This has already been done on [Planemo machine](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo-machine).

### .image-25[![](../../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Quickstart
#### Using Conda outside Planemo

- Install a package

```bash
$ conda install pyyaml
```

- Install some packages within an isolated environment

```bash
$ conda create -n yaml pyyaml
$ conda env list
yaml        *  ~/miniconda3/envs/yaml
root             ~/miniconda3
$ source activate yaml
(yaml) $
```

## Finding the Correct Requirements & Packages

There is a Bioconda recipe named `seqtk` at version `1.2` but how can you find it and any other available versions?

Two easy approaches are using `planemo conda_search` and using the Anaconda web search.

---

class: left

### Using the Planemo `conda_search` Command

The Planemo `conda_search` command is a shortcut around `conda search` that searches best
practice channels that Galaxy is configured to work with:

```sh
$ planemo conda_search seqt
Fetching package metadata ...............
seqtk                        r75                           0  bioconda
                             r82                           0  bioconda
                             r93                           0  bioconda
                             1.2                           0  bioconda
```

Alternatively, `conda` can be used directly:

```sh
$ $HOME/miniconda3/bin/conda -c iuc -c bioconda -c conda-forge seqt
```

### Using Anaconda Search - https://anaconda.org

![](../../images/anaconda_landing.png)


???

---

### Using Anaconda Search - https://anaconda.org

![](../../images/anaconda_result.png)

???

Notice that only one of these results is a best practice channel and so that is the
only one that will be used by Galaxy by default.

---

### .image-25[![](../../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Writing a Conda Recipe

If searching best practice channels fails, you may need to build a Conda recipe.

### .image-25[![](../../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Writing a Conda Recipe - The Files

A Conda recipe is defined by a directory, the two most important files in this directory are:

- `meta.yaml`: contains all the metadata of the recipe
- `build.sh`: the Unix script that installs the files

---

class: left

### .image-25[![](../../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Writing a Conda Recipe - `meta.yaml`

`meta.yaml` contains basic metadata about the recipe.

```yaml
package:
  name: bwa
  version: "0.7.15"
about:
  home: http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net
  license: MIT
  summary: The BWA read mapper.
build:
  number: 0
  skip: True # [osx]
source:
  fn: v0.7.15.tar.gz
  url: https://github.com/lh3/bwa/archive/v0.7.15.tar.gz
  md5: 54fdee953c5c256d36885a1c5c6b118c
```

---

### .image-25[![](../../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Writing a Conda Recipe - `requirements`

```yaml
requirements:
  build:
    - gcc   # [not osx]
    - llvm  # [osx]
    - zlib
  run:
    - zlib
    - bowtie2
```
<small>
- `build`: requirements needed during the build step (here compilation)
- `run`: requirements needed at runtime

</small>

---

### .image-25[![](../../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Writing a Conda Recipe - Preprocessing Selectors

- Evaluated as Python expressions - feel free to use `and`, `or`, etc.
- Other common selectors include `py2k`, `py3k`.

```yaml
requirements:
  build:
    - gcc   # [not osx]

    - zlib
```

```yaml

class: left

### .image-25[![](../../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Writing a Conda Recipe - Tests

<br/>
<br/>

`meta.yaml` should contain simple tests. These are commands executed at the end of `conda build` and expected to return `0` on success.


```yaml
test:
  commands:
    - bowtie2 --version
```

```yaml
test:
  commands:
    - bwa 2>&1 | grep 'index sequences in the'
```

```yaml
test:
  commands:
    - '$R -e "library(''xcms'')"'
```

Please note that the Conda tests run inside the runtime environment and not in the build environment.

.footnote[.center[https://conda.io/docs/building/meta-yaml.html#test-section ]]

---

From Bioconda Guidelines:

> An adequate test must be included in the recipe. An "adequate" test depends on the recipe, but must be able to detect a successful installation. While many packages may ship their own test suite (unit tests or otherwise), including these in the recipe is not recommended since it may timeout the build system on Travis-CI. We especially want to avoid including any kind of test data in the repository.

### .image-25[![](../../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Writing a Conda Recipe - `build.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX
make
make install
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p $PREFIX/bin
cp *.py $PREFIX/bin
```
<small>
- `$PREFIX` is a variable defined by conda when building the package.
- `$PREFIX` usually contains `bin/`, `lib/`, and `include/` that are filled with the package files.
- `$PREFIX` will be loaded in the user environment at runtime: `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `PYTHONPATH`, ...
</small>

---

### .image-25[![](../../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Writing a Conda Recipe - Skeletons

- `conda skeleton pypi <packagename>`
- `conda skeleton cran <packagename>`
- `bioconductor_skeleton.py <packagename>`
- `conda skeleton cpan <packagename>`

These generate pre-filled recipes <small>(not guaranteed to work out of the box)</small> for specific programming environments.

.footnote[[Building conda packages with conda skeleton](https://conda.pydata.org/docs/build_tutorials/pkgs.html)]

---

### .image-25[![](../../../../../shared/images/conda_logo.png)] <br/> Writing a Conda Recipe - Building

Once the recipe is ready to go, the `conda build` command can be used to build it.

```bash
$ $HOME/miniconda3/bin/conda build .
```

1. BUILD START: Builds/Compiles the package
2. BUILD START: Provides a .tar.bz2
3. TEST START: Installs the .tar.bz2 previously generated
4. TEST START: Launches the functional tests
5. (Provides the .tar.bz2 path)


.footnote[If miniconda wasn't configured with `planemo conda_init`, you may have <br/> to run `conda install conda-build` before using the above command.]

### Planemo and `--conda_use_local`

By default, Galaxy and Planemo will ignore locally built packages.

Simply pass `--conda_use_local` to various Planemo commands (e.g. `test`, `conda_install`, or `serve`) to use the local package
cache.

*Enables developing Galaxy tools and Conda recipes in parallel.*

## Pinning Libraries - Use jinja

> If your package links dynamically against a particular library, it is **often necessary to pin the version against which it was compiled, in order to avoid ABI incompatibilities**. Instead of hardcoding a particular version in the recipe, we use jinja templates to achieve this. This **helps ensure that all bioconda packages are binary-compatible with each other**. For example, bioconda provides an environment variable `CONDA_BOOST` that contains the current major version of Boost.

## Stable URLs

```yaml
source:
  fn: v0.7.15.tar.gz
  url: https://github.com/lh3/bwa/archive/v0.7.15.tar.gz
  md5: 54fdee953c5c256d36885a1c5c6b118c
```

> While supported by Conda, `git_url` and `git_rev` are not as stable as a git tarball. Ideally a github repo should have tagged releases that are accessible as tarballs from the “releases” section of the github repo. In addition tarballs can be easily mirrored and Bioconda is saving a copy of every tarball so the recipe can be rebuild at any time.

---

class: left

## Python

For PyPI packages

```sh
conda skeleton pypi <package_name>
```

- Builds likely correct `build.sh` and `meta.yaml`.
- The test automatically added is probably sufficient for library, may need to write extra tests for command-line tools.
- Recipes requiring `python` should build on Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6 by default, preprocessing selectors can be used with `build: skip` to skip targets.

---

## Python - pysam's `build.sh`

```sh
#!/bin/bash

## R (CRAN)

For PyPI packages

```sh
conda skeleton cran <packagename>
```

- Builds likely correct `build.sh` and `meta.yaml`.
- The recipe name will have an `r-` prefix and will be converted to lowercase.
- Typically can be used without modification, though dependencies may also need recipes.

## Java

- New recipes should use the `openjdk` package from [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/openjdk-feedstock).
- Add a wrapper script if the software is typically called via `java -jar`.
- JAR files should go in `$PREFIX/share/$PKG_NAME-$PKG_VERSION-$PKG_BUILDNUM`
- A wrapper script should be placed here as well, and symlinked to $PREFIX/bin.

https://bioconda.github.io/guidelines.html#java

## Metapackages

> Metapackages tie together other packages. All they do is define dependencies. For example, the hubward-all metapackage specifies the various other conda packages needed to get full hubward installation running just by installing one package. Other metapackages might tie together conda packages with a theme. For example, all UCSC utilities related to bigBed files, or a set of packages useful for variant calling.

## simulate-travis

- The extended building and testing done by Travis can be executed locally using the script `simulate-travis.py` in the root directory of Bioconda
- It is mandatory to build any recipe before using simulate-travis.py for the first time.
- It should be run from the top-level dir of the repo.
